# RedWineRanker
RedWineRanker is a machine learning project that aims to classify red wines based on their characteristics. This Project aims Exploratory data analysis &amp; classification work with machine learning models.

To create a Red Wine classification machine learning model, we'll need a dataset containing various attributes of red wines along with their respective classifications (e.g., quality rating). Here's a brief overview of what the dataset might include:

1. **Fixed Acidity**: The amount of non-volatile acids in the wine.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: The amount of volatile acids in the wine, which can contribute to its aroma.
3. **Citric Acid**: The amount of citric acid in the wine, which can impart freshness and flavor.
4. **Residual Sugar**: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation, influencing sweetness.
5. **Chlorides**: The concentration of salts in the wine, which can affect taste and mouthfeel.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: The amount of sulfur dioxide that is not bound to other molecules, important for preservation.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: The total amount of sulfur dioxide present, including both free and bound forms.
8. **Density**: The density of the wine, which is influenced by sugar content and alcohol level.
9. **pH**: The acidity or basicity of the wine.
10. **Sulphates**: The amount of sulphates present, which can act as antioxidants and antimicrobials.
11. **Alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine, which can influence its body and flavor intensity.
12. **Quality (Target)**: The quality rating of the wine, typically on a scale from low to high.

With this dataset, we can train a machine learning model to classify red wines based on their attributes, aiming to predict their quality rating. This model can then be used to classify new wines based on their characteristics, aiding in quality assessment and decision-making in the wine industry.
